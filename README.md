Subject: Request for Approval: NTLM to Kerberos Migration Update

Hi Manish,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to let you know about the recent changes we've made to switch from NTLM to Kerberos in our lower environments (UAT and Dev).

Currently, UAT isn't accessible due to an issue with the Mysecurity component. Our team is working on fixing this. However, we've successfully tested the changes in the Dev environment, and everything seems to be working fine.

Because we need to implement these changes before July 6th, we'd like your approval to proceed with testing in the Dev environment and eventually deploy them to the PROD environment.

Let me know if you have any questions or need more details about the process.

Thanks for your help.

Best regards,
