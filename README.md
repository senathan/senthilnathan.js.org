I hope this email finds you well.

I am currently facing some challenges that are preventing me from proceeding with other tickets:

Safe Creation in Local Environment Setup:

I am able to start Gozeus in the local environment but am unable to create a safe. This issue is blocking further progress.
Dev Pipeline Authentication Issues:

I am experiencing authentication issues that are preventing me from running the dev pipeline. I was able to run it this morning, but now I no longer have access.
Additionally, please find the estimates for the following tickets:

Ticket One: Estimated to take one week.
Ticket Two: Estimated to take 2-3 weeks, as it involves creating new components and the changes required are quite extensive.
I would also like to take this opportunity to appreciate Ravi and Ping, who have been immensely helpful.

Thank you for your attention to these matters. I look forward to your guidance and support to resolve these issues
