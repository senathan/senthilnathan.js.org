Subject: Request for Work from Home and Potential Leave

Hi Andy,

How are you doing?

I would like to work from home on Wednesday as my wife has a doctorâ€™s appointment between 10 AM and 12 PM. Additionally, I need to mention that my grandma is not well and I am her primary caregiver now. If her condition worsens, I may need to travel to India for up to two weeks for her ceremony. I sincerely hope this won't be necessary.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
