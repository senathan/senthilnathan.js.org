### Jira Ticket

**Issue Type:**  
*New Feature*

---

**Summary:**  
*Automate Certificate Bundle Updates in Nexus and APAAS Pod Management*

---

**Description:**

**1. Overview:**
This feature aims to automate the process of updating certificate bundles in Nexus and managing the deployment of pods in APAAS V4. By automating these tasks, we can significantly reduce manual intervention, minimize the risk of errors, and ensure consistent and timely updates across all environments.

**2. Business Need:**
Currently, updating certificates and managing the corresponding pod deployments require manual processes that are time-consuming and prone to errors. This automation will:
- Ensure certificates are consistently and accurately updated across all environments.
- Reduce the time required to perform these updates.
- Eliminate the risk of human error, enhancing the reliability of the system.

**3. Input Parameters:**
- **Certificate File:** The common certificate that needs to be updated.
- **Action Type:** The user must select one of the following actions:
  - **Add:** Add a new certificate to the existing bundle.
  - **Update:** Update an existing certificate within the bundle.
  - **Delete:** Remove an existing certificate from the bundle.

**4. Process Breakdown:**

**Stage 1: Certificate Management in Nexus**
1. **Retrieve Existing Certificates:**
   - The process begins by retrieving the existing certificate bundle from Nexus.
2. **Perform Action:**
   - Based on the user’s selected action:
     - **Add/Update:** The certificate is added to or updated in the existing JSON structure.
     - **Delete:** The certificate is removed from the JSON structure.
3. **Update JSON File:**
   - The JSON file is updated to reflect the changes.
4. **Upload to Nexus:**
   - The updated JSON file is zipped and uploaded back to the appropriate directory in Nexus.

**Stage 2: APAAS Deployment**
1. **Login to APAAS Pods:**
   - The system logs into the relevant APAAS pods for deployment.
2. **Pod Management:**
   - The pods for the `certrenewal` and `certprov` applications are spun down and then spun up again to apply the new certificates.
3. **Repeat for Other Regions:**
   - This process is repeated for all other applicable regions to ensure uniform deployment across environments.
4. **Logout:**
   - The system logs out of the APAAS pods once the process is complete.

**5. Expected Benefits:**
- **Reduced Manual Errors:** Automation minimizes the risk of human error in certificate management and pod deployment.
- **Consistency:** Ensures that all environments are updated uniformly, reducing the risk of discrepancies.
- **Time Savings:** Automating these tasks will save significant time compared to the current manual process.

Subject: Automation Feature Analysis: Certificate Bundle Update and Apaas Pod Management

Hi Andy,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share the approach I'm working on for automating the process of updating certificate bundles in Nexus and managing the pod spin-up in Apaas v4. Here's a brief overview:

**Jenkins Pipeline Overview:**

**Input Parameters:**
1. Read the common certificate to be updated.
2. Select the action to be performed: add, update, or delete.

**Output Stages:**

**Stage 1: Certificate Management**
- A Java library will handle the input and retrieve existing certificates from Nexus.
- Based on the user's selected action (add, update, or delete):
  - The existing JSON file is read.
  - If adding or updating, the new certificates are included in the JSON.
  - If deleting, the specified certificates are removed from the JSON.
- The updated JSON is saved in the appropriate folder, which is then zipped and uploaded back to Nexus.

**Stage
