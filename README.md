Hi Nicola,

I hope this email finds you well.

Yes, we have successfully completed the production deployment yesterday and have also updated the evidence accordingly. Going forward, this pipeline will run in a scheduled manner, keeping vulnerability risks in mind. If a critical vulnerability arises, we will take the latest PR and push it to production immediately. For high vulnerabilities, we will address them within 60 days.

In the future, we can work on a common solution to override the BAU process, aiming to automate the deployment of changes to production without manual intervention.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
