I hope this message finds you well.

We would like to bring to your attention a new feature concerning the ATM device error handling. The feature aims to ensure that the ATM device provides sufficient information when a common error code, such as "Error17," is encountered. This functionality needs to be supported by both the ATM stack application and Certprov APIs.

Our initial analysis indicates that our system is currently passing the correct messages. However, we need to engage with the STACK team to determine whether the existing information is sufficient or if additional details are required from our end.

We have already discussed this matter with Ben Morley and are awaiting his response. To provide some context, this feature will be an ongoing project for 2025.

We look forward to your feedback and collaboration on this matter.
