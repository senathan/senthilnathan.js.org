Hi Manish,

I had a chat with Andy, and we confirmed that the application communicates with my security application, which provides authentication for all CSO internal members. However, the authorization is based on the AD groups that are mapped in the view, where users raise requests via the request portal.

To conclude, there are no restrictions from my security application's end, which communicates with BAM, and BAM internally validates the SES roles.
