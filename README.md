Subject: Clarification Needed About Recent Access Changes

Hi Manish,

I hope you're doing well. I noticed something in the logs regarding recent access changes that I'd like to discuss.

The logs show that access permissions have been updated, as seen in the ticket image. These updates seem to be for informational purposes and don't indicate any errors.

Our application currently manages user access using Active Directory (AD) groups specified in the view. To ensure everything aligns correctly, could you please check if there have been any changes to these AD groups on the database (DB) side?

We mentioned this to RTB yesterday, but it's essential to confirm and verify these details.

Thank you for your help with this.

Best regards,
