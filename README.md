Sure, I'll help you draft an email to your boss explaining the feature analysis and also provide a guideline on how to log this feature in Jira. Since I can’t generate images, I'll describe how you could create a flowchart for your email.

Subject: Proposal for Automated Certificate Bundle Update in Nexus and Pod Management in APAAS V4

Dear Andy,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to share a proposed feature enhancement for automating certificate updates in Nexus and managing pod deployment in APAAS V4. This automation aims to streamline our operations and reduce manual intervention. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the process:

**Feature Overview:**
The automation process involves two main stages:

**Stage 1: Certificate Management in Nexus**
- **Input Parameters:** The user provides the common certificate to be updated and selects the action (add, update, or delete).
- **Process:**
  1. Retrieve existing certificates from Nexus.
  2. Depending on the user action:
     - Add or update: Certificates are added to or updated in the existing JSON file.
     - Delete: Certificates are removed from the JSON file.
  3. The updated JSON file is then saved and zipped.
  4. The zipped folder is uploaded back to Nexus.

**Stage 2: APAAS Deployment**
- **Process:**
  1. Login to APAAS pods.
  2. Spin down and spin up the pods for applications 'certrenewal' and 'certprov' to apply the new certificates.
  3. This process is repeated across other regions as necessary.

**Visual Representation:**
I recommend including a flowchart in this section. Use diagramming tools like Lucidchart or Microsoft Visio to create a flowchart that illustrates the steps outlined above. The flowchart should detail the input parameters, actions (add/update/delete), and the deployment sequence in APAAS.

**Benefits:**
This automation will enhance our operational efficiency by:
- Reducing manual errors.
- Ensuring consistency across deployments.
- Saving time in managing certificates and deploying services.

I believe this enhancement will significantly impact our workflow and I am keen to discuss this further. Please let me know a suitable time for a meeting to discuss this proposal in detail.

Thank you for considering this initiative.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
