Subject: Leave Plan and Travel Schedule

Hi Andy,

Thank you for the support.

I got a few links for our team colleagues, but those aren't working. I will try again this week and next week. 

Please find my plan below. Let me know if you have any questions:

1. I would like to apply for bereavement leave for this week, excluding today.
2. I would like to work for three days next week, from July 30th to August 1st, 2024.
3. I am traveling back to the UK on the night of August 5th and will resume work on August 6th. I will apply for annual leave for the remaining days.

Thanks.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
