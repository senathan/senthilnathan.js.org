Subject: Test Plan for Renewal Component Migration to APAAS

Hi Bhavesh,

I hope you are doing well.

Ben and I had a chat about testing the renewal component, which is expected to be migrated from the Windows server to APAAS. The plan for our initial testing involves bringing down the APAAS pods and adding the URL in the stack run. We will then monitor if the device is communicating and identify any failures during the health check.

Following this initial step, we will proceed with the full execution of the testing.

Could you please provide us with the test plan for this process?

Thank you and looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

[Your Name]

Sure, here is a structured way to deliver this information during a Teams call with Andy:

"Hi Andy,

Yep, I had a chat with our CSM colleagues regarding the onboarding process. They mentioned that setting up as an AD account is the best option instead of a database setup.

The main reason is that for a database configuration, we would need a privileged user account. This account has to be set up by the DBA when the database is initially configured. This privileged user would also need the ability to control other users, including adding, deleting, and maintaining user information such as passwords.

We might not have direct control over this privileged user account, even though it can be managed. Given these complexities, onboarding as a system account, particularly for a few database user accounts, is seen as the best and easiest option to maintain.

I hope this clarifies the reasoning behind the recommendation."
