Subject: Heads Up on My Delayed Return from India

Hi Tariq,

I hope this email finds you well.

As you know, I am currently in India to attend the funeral procedures for my Grandma. My flight from India was scheduled for today but has been delayed by 4 hours, so I'm uncertain about the exact time I will land in Manchester. Most likely, I will arrive by tomorrow.

I wanted to give you a heads up regarding this delay. I will log my absence once I am back in the UK. Please let me know if you have any concerns.

Thanks for your understanding.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
