**Subject:** Request for Testing Availability: mTLS Configuration Update

Hi Alex,

We've recently made some updates to our application to support mTLS and have added both the issuer and intermediate ATM certificates to our truststore (`trustore.jks`). We would like to conduct a round of testing using a virtual device to ensure everything is functioning as expected.

Could you let us know when you're available to discuss this further? Alternatively, if you prefer, we can simply send over the test results for your review.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,

[Your Name]

This email is clear and concise, outlining the updates and requesting either a meeting to discuss or an option to send over the results directly, depending on Alex's preference.
