Subject: Assistance Required for Account Removal and Transfer

Hi Tom,

We are happy to proceed with removing the account detailed below from your safe. We will ensure that the account is moved to another safe, either CSM or CyberArk.

@James - We should connect with MyIT to obtain the password for the account where IAN is the owner. Could you please assist us with this?

Additionally, we would like to know if the account mentioned below is being managed by IIP.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Please provide any specific details about the account to be removed below this line for clarity.


Hi Ben,

I know you guys are using Windows system accounts with the prefix 'SVC-'. We would like to know how these are managed in either CSM or CyberArk. Are they unmanaged or managed?

Thanks!
