### Jira Ticket

**Issue Type:**  
*New Feature*

---

**Summary:**  
*Automate Certificate Bundle Updates in Nexus and APAAS Pod Management*

---

**Description:**

**1. Overview:**
This feature aims to automate the process of updating certificate bundles in Nexus and managing the deployment of pods in APAAS V4. By automating these tasks, we can significantly reduce manual intervention, minimize the risk of errors, and ensure consistent and timely updates across all environments.

**2. Business Need:**
Currently, updating certificates and managing the corresponding pod deployments require manual processes that are time-consuming and prone to errors. This automation will:
- Ensure certificates are consistently and accurately updated across all environments.
- Reduce the time required to perform these updates.
- Eliminate the risk of human error, enhancing the reliability of the system.

**3. Input Parameters:**
- **Certificate File:** The common certificate that needs to be updated.
- **Action Type:** The user must select one of the following actions:
  - **Add:** Add a new certificate to the existing bundle.
  - **Update:** Update an existing certificate within the bundle.
  - **Delete:** Remove an existing certificate from the bundle.

**4. Process Breakdown:**

**Stage 1: Certificate Management in Nexus**
1. **Retrieve Existing Certificates:**
   - The process begins by retrieving the existing certificate bundle from Nexus.
2. **Perform Action:**
   - Based on the user’s selected action:
     - **Add/Update:** The certificate is added to or updated in the existing JSON structure.
     - **Delete:** The certificate is removed from the JSON structure.
3. **Update JSON File:**
   - The JSON file is updated to reflect the changes.
4. **Upload to Nexus:**
   - The updated JSON file is zipped and uploaded back to the appropriate directory in Nexus.

**Stage 2: APAAS Deployment**
1. **Login to APAAS Pods:**
   - The system logs into the relevant APAAS pods for deployment.
2. **Pod Management:**
   - The pods for the `certrenewal` and `certprov` applications are spun down and then spun up again to apply the new certificates.
3. **Repeat for Other Regions:**
   - This process is repeated for all other applicable regions to ensure uniform deployment across environments.
4. **Logout:**
   - The system logs out of the APAAS pods once the process is complete.

**5. Expected Benefits:**
- **Reduced Manual Errors:** Automation minimizes the risk of human error in certificate management and pod deployment.
- **Consistency:** Ensures that all environments are updated uniformly, reducing the risk of discrepancies.
- **Time Savings:** Automating these tasks will save significant time compared to the current manual process.

Subject: Approach for Automating Certificate Bundle Updates and Pod Deployment

Hi Andy,

I wanted to share the approach I'm working on for automating the certificate bundle updates in Nexus and the corresponding pod deployments in Apaas v4. Below is a brief overview of the proposed solution:

**Jenkins Pipeline:**

**Input Parameters:**
1. Identify the common certificate that needs to be updated.
2. Select the desired action: add, update, or delete.

**Output:**

**Stage 1: Certificate Management**
1. We have a Java library that will take the inputs and check for the existing certificates in Nexus.
2. The action specified by the user (add, update, or delete) will be performed:
   - Read the existing JSON file.
   - If adding or updating, the new certificates will be incorporated into the existing JSON.
   - If deleting, the specified certificates will be removed from the JSON.
3. The updated JSON file will be saved back to the folder.
4. Finally, the folder will be zipped and uploaded back to Nexus.

**Stage 2: Apaas Deployment**
1. Log in to the Apaas pods.
2. Spin down and spin up the pods for both the `certrenewal` and `certprov` applications.
3. Log out and perform the same steps for other regions as needed.

Please let me know if you have any feedback or if there's anything else you'd like me to include.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
