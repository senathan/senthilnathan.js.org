**Subject:** Update on Renewal Migration and Current Workload

I wanted to give you a heads-up on our progress with the renewal migration of the C# component to the APaaS using the Java API. The component has been successfully delivered, but we encountered an issue during the mTLS testing phase. The device couldn’t establish communication with the APaaS due to a known issue that was identified years ago. Fortunately, we have a workaround solution provided by the STACK team — the STFU Utility, which is currently in use. However, we are still evaluating the execution time for this solution.

Additionally, we are planning to move the existing C# component from Windows Server 2019 to Windows Server 2022 to ensure better compatibility and performance.

On a separate note regarding our current workload on the ATM, as per our initial planning for Q3, one item is currently in progress. Besides this, we are also looking into other improvement tickets. You can view these updates on our JIRA board for more detailed information.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need further details on any of these points.
